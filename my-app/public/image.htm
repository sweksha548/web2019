          <p class="text4">I got interested in understanding what convolutional neural networks were and how they were formed to explore the concept of 'creation of unique visual experiences through the composition of a complex interplay between the content and style of images', which led me to paintings and artwork.</p>

          <p class="text4">It led me to think of the themes and context based on which varied forms of art have been created in the past, the stark similarities in style, the ways in which that style was carried forward in similar themes of artwork. I want to explore the extent of similarities and differences in the works of artists, exhibited in different museums. </p>

        <p class="text2">Interestingly, different works of Van Gogh exhibited in diff museums were clustered together. Which indicated that the algorithm identifies the similar use of stroke patterns, colors and style by Van Gogh in his diff paintings.</p>
        <p class="text2">Exhibits that had similar look and feel in terms of a dominant color, were also clustered together, like those which were red and pink.</p>
        <p class="text2">Paintings that had similar stroke style, esp. I noticed Paul cezzane and Van gogh’s works were here.</p>
        <p class="text2">All images of the hallways which had a lot of paintings.</p>
        <p class="text2">And sculptures, all dominantly white or grey in color.</p>
