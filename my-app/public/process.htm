      <p class="text1">1. GETTING THE AUDIO FILES</p>
      <p class="text2" style="margin-top: 50px;">Since 1973, the Ellis Island Oral History project has been dedicated to preserving the first-hand recollections of immigrants who passed through the Ellis Island immigration station between 1892 and 1954 and the employees who worked there. Over the years, the project has grown to include approximately 1900 interviews. </p>

          <p class="text3" style="margin-top: 50px;">Stopwords are the English words which does not add much meaning to a sentence.  </p>
          <p class="text3" style="margin-top: 50px;">Tokenizing is the process of breaking a stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. </p>
          <p class="text3" style="margin-top: 50px;">Stemming is the process of reducing inflection in words to their root forms such as mapping a group of words to the same stem even if the stem itself is not a valid word in the Language. </p>

      <p class="text1">6. COSINE SIMILARITY- 800 INTERVIEWS</p>
      <p class="text4">Cosine-similarity helps determine how similar the documents are irrespective of size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. In this context, the two vectors I am talking about are arrays containing the word counts of two documents.</p>
      <p class="text4">When plotted on a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word in the document, you need the word count of the words in each document.</p>
      <p class="text4">The CountVectorizer or the TfidfVectorizer from scikit learn lets us compute this. The output of this comes as a sparse_matrix.</p>

      <p class="text1">7. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SCALING</p>
      <p class="text4">Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a dataset. MDS is used to translate "information about the pairwise 'distances' among a set of n objects or individuals" into a configuration of n points mapped into an abstract Cartesian space.</p>

      <p class="text1">10. INFERENCES</p>
      <p class="text4">The algorithm did a fair job at clustering scripts that talked about similar aspects interms of loss, finding happiness. </p>
      <p class="text4">Transcripts that talked about killings, murders & about losing people were all together.</p>
      <p class="text4">Some clusters had answers that talked about war, and movement.</p>
      <p class="text4">And some clusters were also about resettling and finding happiness again. Had words like hope, happiness.</p><br><br>
      <p class="text4">The plot represented these different clusters based on the frequencies of common words between them.</p>
      <p class="text4">For eg. You would notice that most of the blue and the green clusters are together as they have words that overlapped while talking about their journey. Say, most of the conversions did mentions parents, father and brothers, which overlapped with say movement.</p>
    </div><br><br>

    <div>
      <p class="text1">11. NEXT STEPS</p>
      <p class="text4">Find more comprehensive ways of representing text clusters and work on making them more interactive.</p>
